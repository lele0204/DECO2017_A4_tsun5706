# I. Iterations
## 1. Task Page

The previous design had a reduced icons in the lower right corner. Since after the first round of user testing, some users reported that there were too many repetitive features appeared in the same interface, so I deleted those small icons to avoid making people confusing about them. Moreover, the previous designs lacked the functions of editing tasks and removing column, so I added icons to allow the user to edit and delete.

## 2. Timer Page

The initial design indicated the sessions in the timer, I changed the words into numbers and add the percentage in it to let people check the progress easier. Also, I add the title on the top of the timer so that users can feel free to change the timer mode according their needs.

## 3. Close/Hide Tab

The original design had three icons available for people to close, hide, or edit the interface. However, users pointed out that could be less icons because they can also edit the time by clicking the buttons below. So I delete the edit icon and change the display mode which can be only open one tab every time. Since it is disordered when the page showed too many tabs at once.

# IV. Reflection
