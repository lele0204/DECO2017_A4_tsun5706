# I. Iterations
## 1. Task Page

The previous design had a reduced icons in the lower right corner. Since after the first round of user testing, some users reported that there were too many repetitive features appeared in the same interface, so I deleted those small icons to avoid making people confusing about them. Moreover, the previous designs lacked the functions of editing tasks and removing column, so I added icons to allow the user to edit and delete.

## 2. Timer Page

The initial design indicated the sessions in the timer, I changed the words into numbers and add the percentage in it to let people check the progress easier. Also, I add the title on the top of the timer so that users can feel free to change the timer mode according their needs.

## 3. Close/Hide Tab

The original design had three icons available for people to close, hide, or edit the interface. However, users pointed out that could be less icons because they can also edit the time by clicking the buttons below. So I delete the edit icon and change the display mode which can be only open one tab every time. Since it is disordered when the page showed too many tabs at once.

# II. Reflection
Challenges:
1. Drag and drop: Since I haven't practiced many such examples before, I completed it after searching the mdn web docs cases, checking the parameters, and trying again and again.
2. Set timers: It is pretty hard to set the total number of custom time countdowns, rest times, session times to cycle the timer, and rest time, and I learned SVG to draw the loop progress bar to figure them out.

I initially restored the static page during encoding through the designed UI diagram. After that, I continue to try to recall js, render the page, and store data for add and delete. I used the code rules that I learned last semester and constantly tried to write repeatedly. Finally, I successfully finished the project writing. On the other hand, the network proposal still has many shortcomings. The main page still needs improvement to scroll horizontally to see more. Also, the timers should be optimized to let users add/reduce time by clicking buttons rather than typing numbers. And the music player would be more effective if it would allow people to search for or import their local music. And I will put more effort into fixing them next time.
